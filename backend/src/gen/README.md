# About this directory

```text
This directory contains the generated code from the proto generation process.

The code in this directory is automatically generated from protobuf files using a code generation tool. It includes classes, methods, and other code structures that correspond to the defined messages and services in the protobuf files.

Please note that the code in this directory should not be modified directly, as any changes made here will be overwritten the next time the proto generation process is run.
